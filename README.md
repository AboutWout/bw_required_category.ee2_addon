# BW Required Category

Makes categories required for specified channels.

### Info

Developed by Wouter Vervloet, http://www.baseworks.nl/

BW Required Category is an *ExpressionEngine 2* add-on and won't be ported to ExpressionEngine 1.x. If you are looking for a EE 1.x solution, I suggest you check out Designchuchi's [DC Required Category](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/dc-required-category/) as it equally (or even more) awesome.

### Installation

Drop the entire bw_required_category folder in the third_party folder:

    /system/expressionengine/third_party/auto_expire/


### Usage

After installing BW Required Category you set the channel preferences on the extension settings page. BW Required Category is either turned on or off for a specific channel.
